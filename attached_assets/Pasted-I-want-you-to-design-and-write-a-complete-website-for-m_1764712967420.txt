I want you to design and write a complete website for my brand:

Name: Civil CI
Full Name: Civil CI — Civil Citizens Intelligence
Tagline(s):

“For the people. Be the people.”

“Fire, focus, and forensic clarity.”

1. What Civil CI Is

Civil CI is:

A civil-rights intelligence unit for regular people

A forensic case reconstruction + misconduct analysis hub

A watchdog + support system for people targeted by systems of power (small towns, counties, agencies, prosecutors, police, courts, etc.)

We help people like Jeremy Austin—those who’ve been railroaded, targeted, or buried in corrupt small-town and county systems—turn chaos into a clear, documented, strategic record.

Tone:

Fierce, intelligent, forensic

Emotional but controlled

Movement energy, not corporate

Feels like an underground civil-rights intelligence division, but professional enough for lawyers and courts to take seriously.

2. Brand Style

Colors:

Background: almost black / deep charcoal

Main red: dark, powerful red (for headings and emphasis)

Gold: warm gold (for underlines, accents, buttons, highlights)

Text: off-white for readability

Imagery:

Forensic / investigative / war-room style

Smoke, light streaks, evidence boards, timelines, documents, maps, string lines

No cheesy courthouse stock photos

Fonts (or similar):

Headings: elegant serif (like Cormorant Garamond)

Body: modern clean sans-serif (like Montserrat)

3. Pages / Sections I Want

Build this as a one-page site with sections (or multiple pages if needed):

A. HERO SECTION (Top of page)

Goal: instantly show that Civil CI is a citizen-powered civil-rights intelligence unit.

Hero text to use and refine:

CIVIL CI — CIVIL CITIZENS INTELLIGENCE
For the people. Be the people.
When the system targets you, we stand with you.
When counties conspire, we expose the pattern.
Civil CI is a civil-rights intelligence unit for regular people — a forensic case reconstruction and misconduct analysis hub, and a watchdog support system for anyone targeted by systems of power.

Buttons in hero:

Primary CTA: “Book a Case Review”

Secondary CTA: “Explore Services”

Right side of hero should show a strong, dark-toned portrait/photo or forensic-style image that matches the brand.

B. “WHAT WE DO” SECTION

Explain, in clear language, that Civil CI does three core things:

Civil Rights Intelligence for Regular People

Turn messy cases into timelines, maps, and clear summaries.

Forensic Case Reconstruction & Misconduct Analysis

Rebuild events, examine warrants, reports, filings, footage, etc.

Identify contradictions, patterns, rights violations.

Watchdog & Support System Against Abusive Power

Help people pressured or targeted by local power structures.

Provide structure and documentation they can use with lawyers, courts, agencies, and media.

Make this section feel like “this is bigger than consulting; this is an intelligence unit for citizens.”

C. SERVICES SECTION

Create service cards for:

Case Reconstruction Package

Full timeline, evidence map, contradiction analysis, strategic summary.

Describe who it’s for and why it’s powerful.

Civil Rights Misconduct Review

Deep dive into official conduct, cross-county patterns, affidavit/warrant issues, prosecutorial behavior, etc.

Affidavit & Narrative Support

Helping clients structure their story, affidavits, declarations, and written statements aligned with evidence.

Pro Se Support (Ongoing)

Monthly/ongoing structure + support for people representing themselves.

Strategy Sessions

60–90 minute focused consult to get clarity and next steps.

You can invent placeholder pricing or leave it “Contact for pricing,” but keep the tone confident and boutique-level.

D. “HOW IT WORKS” SECTION

4-step process:

Book a Case Review (intake + fit check)

Secure Intake & Evidence (gather docs, footage, filings)

Forensic Reconstruction (build timeline, identify misconduct, create clarity)

Strategy Handoff (give client a clear, structured record and next steps)

Make this feel simple and safe for someone overwhelmed.

E. ABOUT SECTION

Write an “About” that explains:

Civil CI was born out of a real, brutal case where small-town counties conspired, abused their power, forged or altered documents, retaliated, and tried to bury one man and his story.

Instead of giving up, we documented everything, learned the systems, and realized how many other people were living the same kind of nightmare.

Now Civil CI stands in that gap: not a law firm, not a government office — but a citizen-built intelligence unit dedicated to exposing what they try to hide.

Include one strong, poetic quote in this section, like:

“They thought we’d stay overwhelmed and alone. Instead, we built an intelligence unit for everyone they ever targeted.”

F. CONTACT SECTION

Create a Contact / Case Review section with:

Short text explaining:

who should reach out (people dealing with misconduct, railroading, corruption, small-town power abuse, etc.),

what to send (brief summary, deadlines, not every document yet),

reassurance that everything is kept confidential.

A simple form with:

Name

Email

Optional Phone

Case Summary / Message

Urgency / upcoming deadlines

Button text: “Send Case Summary” or “Request Review”.

4. Tone Guidelines

Throughout the entire site, write copy that feels:

Fierce and uncompromising, but not unhinged

Poetic in places, sharp as a warning in others

Trauma-aware and respectful of what people are going through

Anti-corruption, pro-citizen, pro-truth

Confident in the work without promising legal outcomes

It should feel like a movement and an elite investigative service at the same time.

5. Deliverables

A complete website structure (sections, headings, subheadings, body copy).

Suggested layout (hero, sections order, CTAs).

If possible: clean HTML/CSS structure matching the above style.

All text should be ready to paste into a website builder.
